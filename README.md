# Job application managing app

This app is built for managing job applications, still in building process

I am looking for a web developer job right now, I need to send out quite many applications every week, it is hard to manage all those job applications, recruiter contacts, interviews in one place, so I think why not build a such app by myself.

stack: React, Nextjs, Apollo, Graphql, Typescript, Chakra-ui

## Scrape job ad info from internet

At first, I was thinking using indeed open Api, but it is closed for registration, so all I can think is to scrape data from recruiter site like: indeed and seek.

a url can be submitted to app, and it will fetch job ad info from the page, and save the basic data to database. This method is not so aggressive in scraping data, as I don't want to be blocked by Seek or Indeed.

## Update and show some key requirements or infomation that stand out for the user's attention

it is not so realistic to read and remember the whole job ad, it is good that some key infomation would popup.

## Add recruiter contacts to database

every phone call is precious for job searching, it is important that a contact can be saved and showed properly.

## Followup events like: interview | phone call | email

it can show time type of the events, and can also add note to the events, like how it is going, what to expect or prepare the next event

## Update application status like: to be applied | applied | terminated

status is useful for sorting applications, to really focus on those applications that are hopeful
